### PHONEBOOK

On my phonebook, I selected three users as previously defined
in this program I use only If else Selection to filter usernames
the phone number if there is no it will immediately redirect to the User Name Not Found

### ANAGRAM

in the first anagram I use the if else selection to determine whether there is a value or not and the length of x, y and the value is the same or not and then compare it letter by letter by looping from the previous value
 

### PALINDROM

For Palindrom here I only use while to loop and then check the value so that I can find words with the same phrase in front and behind
